This term, I became familiar witht the Agile framework, which is a way of completing a project that allows for continuous planning, development, and feedback. This method often ensures a more satisfactory product can be delivered to the client/stakeholders. Tasks are completed through user 'stories' that are organized on a backlog by the product owner in collaboration with the rest of the team. As a devloper, I will be invovlved in this process in an Agile environment, which will allow me to grow my corporate skills and may even allow me to become a product owner one day. A good team member is one who knows what is required of him and is confident in his ability to get there, whether it be through known means or means that must be learned along the way.
